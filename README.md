# Getting Started with Power Apps

This project documents my first steps in learning and exploring **Microsoft Power Apps**, with the goal of understanding its **basic features and functions**.

## 🎯 Objective

To become familiar with Power Apps by:
- Understanding the purpose and capabilities of the platform
- Exploring the Maker Portal
- Designing and building a basic canvas app
- Exporting the app and publishing it to GitHub for version control

## 📌 Overview

Power Apps is a low-code development platform that empowers users to build custom business apps that connect to your data and work across web and mobile. It enables organizations to solve process-related problems with tailored applications without requiring heavy development experience.

## 🛠 What I intend to Build

- **App Name**: Basic Task Tracker
- **Type**: Canvas App (Phone Layout)
- **Data Source**: (To be defined — e.g., SharePoint List, Excel on OneDrive)
- **Features**:
  - Add new tasks (title + notes)
  - Mark tasks as complete
  - Simple UI with intuitive controls
  - Prepared for mobile use

## 📂 Files

- `TaskTracker.msapp` — Exported Power Apps canvas app file
- `README.md` — Project overview and learning summary

## 🚀 How to Use Through Git

To open and use Power App:

1. Sign up for a **Power Apps Developer Plan**:
   - [https://powerapps.microsoft.com/developerplan](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/developerplan)
